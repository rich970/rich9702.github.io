This is a space where I post my completed and ongoing projects. The nature of these vary across my interests, which include data science, hobby electronics, folk music, science and technology. The result is quite a mixed bag, a smorgasbord of blog posts.

I think of this as learning in public. For me, it is a place to track my projects and motivate me to maintain progress on them, with the added bonus that others (_may!_) find it a useful resource or a source of inspiration.
