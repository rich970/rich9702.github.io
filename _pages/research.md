## High entropy alloys
These alloys are concocted to have no single base element, instead having many elemental components mixed in near equal atomic proportions. Competing thermodynamic contributions, including a high entropy of mixing, help to stabilise solid solutions with simple crystalline phases. The alloy composition can be further tuned to obtain nanoprecipitation and the formation of ordered phases alongside the solid solution, to influence the magnetic functionality.  Richard is interested in combining high-throughput experiments with computational methods for the design of high entropy alloys with functional magnetic properties useful for transformers, inductors, electromagnets and electromagnetic shielding.

## Magnetoplasmonics and magneto-optics
Plasmonics allows the confinement of light on nanoscopic lengthscales. When coupled with magnetism, an external magnetic field can be used to control the optical properties of a material through enhanced magneto-optical effects.  Magnetoplasmonics combines the fields of magnetism and plasmonics in the realisation of nanostructured magnetic surfaces with applications in telecommunications and biosensing.

##  Thin-film, interfacial magnetism and spintronics
Exotic magnetic materials can be created by precisely layering nanometer thickness metallic films, creating artificial crystals where interfaces make up a substantial volume of the total material. These can be used to engineer magnetic properties that wouldn’t exist in naturally occurring materials. Such materials have practical significance for the field of spintronics, which aims to understand how the spin of the electron (which is responsible for magnetism) can be used to process or store information.
