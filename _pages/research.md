I work as a researcher at the University of Sheffield. I am a material scientist, with a passion for magnetic materials and their applications.
Although, this is my personal website (see [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-rowan-robinson/), [employee profile](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/materials/people/research-staff/richard-rowan-robinson), [googleScholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qtSIPc0AAAAJ&hl=en) for my professional pages), I am fortunate to have a job that I love and merges with my personal interests, therefore it seems appropriate to summarise my research below, which does at time feed into the projects I do in my free time at home.

## Magnetoplasmonics and magneto-optics
In specially designed nanostructured materials, light can strongly couple to electrons and gets squeezed down to nanoscopic dimensions. We call this squeezed light a 'plasmon'. When plasmons are coupled with magnetism, an external magnetic field can be used to control the optical properties of a material through enhanced magneto-optical effects.  Magnetoplasmonics combines the fields of magnetism and plasmonics in the realisation of nanostructured magnetic surfaces with applications in telecommunications, remote sensing and optical-control of magnetism.

##  Thin-film, interfacial magnetism and spintronics
Exotic magnetic materials can be created by precisely layering nanometer thickness metallic films, creating artificial crystals where interfaces make up a substantial volume of the total material. These can be used to engineer magnetic properties that wouldn’t exist in naturally occurring materials. Such materials have practical significance for the field of spintronics, which aims to understand how the spin of the electron (which is responsible for magnetism) can be used to process or store information.

## High entropy alloys
These alloys are concocted to have no single base element, instead having many elemental components mixed in near equal proportions. Competing thermodynamic contributions can result in a range of behaviour, from stablesing simple ordered crystalline phases to the precipitation of nano-scale grains. Controlling this texture can influence the magnetic functionality, but finding useful alloy compositions is challenging due to the complex interactions of the all the competing elements.  To address this, I combine high-throughput experiments with data-driven material informatics for the design of high entropy alloys with functional magnetic properties useful for transformers, inductors, electromagnets and electromagnetic shielding.
