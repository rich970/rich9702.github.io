I've been interested to see if the pandemic has had an effect on the number of published research articles. My University was quick to close down when COVID hit the UK, and for those reliant on laboratory work, research quickly ground to a halt. Conversaly, we were spending more time at home, with less distractions in the form of shiny equipment to tinker with. So perhaps, there was finally the time (and motivation) to finalise those articles that had been hanging on the Trello board for so long. 

So as 2020 drew to a close, I wanted to look into whether COVID had indeed had an impact on academic output or whether it was unchanged by the pandemic. To me, the best place to do this was to look at the number of publications per year. 

To obtain this data I manually submitted search querries to Web of Science. I restricted the search to their core collection, returning only articles and those written in English.
